# Abstract, if available
abstract: >
  The current design for authentication for the Rubin Science Platform
  leaks cookies and user tokens to backend services.  This undermines
  isolation between services, which could become relevant if a service is
  compromised.  This document proposes several possible alternative
  designs, including one that uses separate hostnames for each Rubin
  Science Platform service, and discusses the complexity and effort
  trade-offs.
